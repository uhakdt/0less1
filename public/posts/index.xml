      <description>To my Fellow Padawans,
My name is Mier(o) Rashid. I will attempt to teach Reinforcement Learning as I learn it myself. I am doing this independently and in order to enter the RL community. Eventually my objective is to be either hired as a RL Researcher or study towards a PhD program (not sure yet [well, I need to get positions first hahaha]).
I will start off with the absolute basics and work my way up.</description>
