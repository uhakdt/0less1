      <description>This Blog is for me to help myself and whats infinitely more important others, to understand concepts in the fields of Mathematics &amp;amp; Computer Science. Every now and then, I will diverge into other topics that will still be connected to M &amp;amp; CS, but nonetheless interesting to myself.
I will consistently try to create a post a day on simple topics initially and slowly build up into more complicated ones.</description>

      <description>I am a Mathematics &amp;amp; Computer Science undergraduate Student at the University of Southampton with a background in Design Engineering &amp;amp; Biology. I am interested in the following topics (meaning I may post about any of these at any point in time, though the more frequent and consistent content will be in Mathematics &amp;amp; Computer Science):
Machine Learning (mainly Reinforcement Learning), One-shot Learning, Robotics, Cosmology, Chemistry, Neuroscience, linguistics, music, philosophy, economics, analysis of algorithms, BlockChain, Cyber Security, Logic, History and some other topics.</description>
