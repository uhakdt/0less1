#### Introduction
I will first give an overview of what Reinforcement Learning (RL) is and then introduce the subject by providing analogies to the concept of RL. Then provide definitions, explain some of the basic Mathematics, and finally some python code to go along with it.
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(DiagrammeR)
```
#### Overview
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height=2}
DiagrammeR::mermaid("
graph TB
    a --  --> d
    d --  --> a
    d --  --> a
")
```
