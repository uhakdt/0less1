<p>This Blog is for me to help myself and whats infinitely more important others, to understand concepts in the fields of Mathematics &amp; Computer Science. Every now and then, I will diverge into other topics that will still be connected to M &amp; CS, but nonetheless interesting to myself.</p>
<p>I will consistently try to create a post a day on simple topics initially and slowly build up into more complicated ones. The bulk of the theory that I will touch on will be in Mathematics and the bulk of applications in real world will be in Computer Science, which should not be surprising.</p>
<p>The topics I will tackle for the next month or so are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Real n-space<br />
</li>
<li>Matrix Algebra<br />
</li>
<li>Systems of Linear Equations<br />
</li>
<li>Determinants<br />
</li>
<li>Linear Transformations<br />
</li>
<li>Subspaces of R^n<br />
</li>
<li>Eigenvalues, eigenvectors &amp; applications<br />
</li>
<li>Orthonormal sets &amp; quadratic forms</li>
</ul>
