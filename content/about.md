I am a Mathematics & Computer Science undergraduate Student at the University of Southampton with a background in Design Engineering & Biology. I am interested in the following topics (meaning I may post about any of these at any point in time, though the more frequent and consistent content will be in Mathematics & Computer Science):  
Machine Learning (mainly Reinforcement Learning), One-shot Learning, Robotics, Cosmology, Chemistry, Neuroscience, linguistics, music, philosophy, economics, analysis of algorithms, BlockChain, Cyber Security, Logic, History and some other topics.  

The people I look up to and admire are the following:  
Donald Ervin Knuth ("The Don"), Noam Chomsky, Claude Shannon, Terence Tao, Andrew Wiles, Isaac Newton, Haidin Rashid, Kurt GÃ¶del, Johnny von Neumann, Elon Musk, Richard Feynman, Caucher Birker, Albert Einstein, James C. Maxwell and many others.
